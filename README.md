# Heart Disease Detection

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection is critical for saving lives and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical expertise and various tests, which may not always provide timely and accurate predictions. This project aims to enhance the prediction and diagnosis of heart disease by applying machine learning (ML) techniques to leverage data-driven insights.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease. By utilizing patient data, the models aim to provide accurate and timely predictions that can aid in early diagnosis and treatment.

### Models Used

- **XGB Classifier**
- **KNeighbors Classifier**
- **KNeighbors Classifier (Hyper-tuned)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Classifier**
- **Stacking Classifier**

## Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution, relationships, and key features.
   - Visualizations and summary statistics are provided to explore the data.

2. **Model Building**
   - Implementation and training of various machine learning models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing the performance of selected models.
   - Evaluation of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
